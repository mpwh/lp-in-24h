# Landing Page in 24 Hours - Service Definition

## Overview
A productized landing page service built by Pandu (founder of Etalas). Using AI-powered development tools (Claude, Cursor), I ship beautiful, conversion-optimized landing pages in under 24 hours — or you don't pay.

**Target Market:** Small businesses, startups, indie hackers, SaaS founders who need to move FAST.

**Unique Selling Proposition:** 
- Built by an agency founder (not a junior dev or freelancer marketplace)
- AI-accelerated development (same quality, 10x speed)
- Money-back guarantee on delivery time
- No agencies, no teams, no bureaucracy — just me + AI
