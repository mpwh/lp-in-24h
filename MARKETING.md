## 📘 LinkedIn Post (Viral-Style, Personal Story Angle)

### Version 1: "I Shipped 3 Landing Pages This Week"

```
I shipped 3 landing pages this week.

Not with a team.
Not with an agency.
Just me + Claude.

Here's what happened:

Monday: Client messages me. "Need a landing page ASAP."
Tuesday morning: I send a 10-question brief.
Tuesday night: Page is live. Client is blown away.

This happened 3 times this week.

Same pattern:
- Client needs a page FAST
- Agencies quote $3K and 2 weeks
- I ship it in 24 hours for $300-500

How?

I'm an agency founder who's built 100+ landing pages.
I know what works.
I know what converts.

But I don't code everything by hand anymore.

I use AI (Claude, Cursor) to 10x my output.
Same quality. Same care. Just faster.

And I realized: This is a product.

So I'm packaging it.

"Landing Page in 24 Hours"
- $300 (standard) or $500 (premium)
- Built by me (not a junior dev)
- Deployed on Vercel
- 1-2 rounds of revisions
- If I miss the deadline, you don't pay

Who's it for?
- Startups launching this week
- Indie hackers testing an idea
- Small businesses tired of slow agencies

I'm taking 3 more clients this week.

If you need a landing page (or know someone who does), DM me.

Let's ship.

---

P.S. This is not a "build your own website" tool.
This is me, personally, building your page.
With AI as my co-pilot.

P.P.S. Yes, I built this landing page with Claude in 2 hours.
Meta? Maybe. Effective? Definitely.
```

---

### Version 2: "The Agency Founder Who Became a Solo Builder"

```
I run a software agency.

But this week, I went solo.

Here's why:

A founder friend messaged me:
"Need a landing page. Can you do it for $300 and ship it tomorrow?"

My agency would've quoted $2-3K and taken 2 weeks.

So I said "yes" personally.

I spent 3 hours with Claude and Cursor.
Built a beautiful Astro + Tailwind page.
Deployed on Vercel.
Sent the link the next morning.

He loved it.
Paid immediately.
Referred 2 friends.

That's when I realized:

There's a gap in the market.

Freelancers on Fiverr? Hit or miss.
Agencies? Slow and expensive.
DIY tools? You still need to do it yourself.

But a founder who builds with AI?

Fast. High-quality. Personally invested.

So I'm launching:
"Landing Page in 24 Hours"

$300-500. Built by me. 24h delivery or free.

Who's it for?
- You're launching next week
- You don't have $3K for an agency
- You want someone who GETS it

This isn't a side hustle.
This is how I build now.

AI isn't replacing me.
It's making me 10x faster.

And I'm passing that speed to you.

DM me if you need a page.
Or comment if you know someone who does.

Let's ship. 🚀

## 🔥 Indie Hackers Post

### Title: "Launched a Productized Service: Landing Pages in 24 Hours for $300-500"

```markdown
**TL;DR:** I'm an agency founder who's packaging my landing page skills into a productized service. Using AI (Claude + Cursor), I can ship beautiful, conversion-optimized landing pages in 24 hours. $300-500. If I miss the deadline, you don't pay.

---

## The Backstory

I run [Etalas](https://etalas.com), a software agency. We usually charge $2-5K for landing pages and take 1-2 weeks.

But this week, a founder friend asked me: "Can you just build me a landing page for $300 and ship it tomorrow?"

I said yes.

Spent 3 hours with Claude and Cursor. Built a clean Astro + Tailwind page. Deployed on Vercel. Sent the link the next morning.

He loved it. Paid immediately. Referred 2 friends.

That's when I realized: **This is a product.**

---

## What I'm Offering

**"Landing Page in 24 Hours"**

- **$300** (standard, up to 5 sections) or **$500** (premium, up to 8 sections + integrations)
- Built by me personally (not outsourced)
- AI-accelerated (Claude, Cursor)
- Deployed on Vercel
- 1-2 rounds of revisions
- **Money-back guarantee:** If I miss the 24h deadline, you don't pay.

---

## Who's It For?

- Startups launching this week
- Indie hackers testing an MVP
- Small businesses who can't afford $3K agency prices
- Anyone who needs to move FAST

---

## The Process

1. **Book a call** (or skip straight to the brief)
2. **Fill a 10-question brief** (brand, copy, sections, references)
3. **I build with AI** (12-20 hours)
4. **You review & revise** (1-2 rounds)
5. **I deploy** (Vercel + GitHub handoff)

---

## Why AI?

I've built 100+ landing pages. I know what converts. I know what structure works.

AI doesn't replace that expertise. It just makes me 10x faster.

- Claude helps with design & structure
- Cursor writes 80% of the code
- I review, refine, and ship

Same quality. Just faster.

---

## The Goal

Get **2-3 clients this week** and hit **$1K revenue**.

If it works, I'll keep it running as a side product alongside the agency.

If there's demand, I might build a small team around it (but I'll still be hands-on).

---

## The Landing Page

I built the landing page for this service... with AI, of course.

Took 2 hours. Deployed on Vercel.

Check it out: [your-landing-page-url]

## Questions?

- **"Can I see examples?"** → I'll share 2-3 recent projects during our call.
- **"What if I need it in 12 hours?"** → Add $100 rush fee.
- **"Do you write the copy?"** → You provide rough copy, I polish it. Full copywriting is $150 extra.
- **"What if I don't like it?"** → You get revisions. If it's really not working, we'll figure it out.
