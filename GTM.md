## Pricing Validation Strategy

### Launch Week Pricing (Feb 10–16)
| Tier | Regular | Launch Price | Deposit |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Standard | $300 | $250 | $125 upfront |
| Premium | $500 | $400 | $200 upfront |

**Why discount?** First 3 clients = social proof. Worth more than the $50-100 discount.

**Validation signals:**
- If 3+ people book at launch price → regular price is validated, raise back to $300/$500
- If people hesitate at $250 → consider $199 entry point
- If people ask for more features → Premium upsell is working
- Track: conversion rate from DM → call → brief → payment

### Price Anchoring in All Copy
Always mention: "Agencies charge $2-5K and take 2 weeks. I do it in 24h for $300-500."

---

## Marketing Channels — Detailed Playbook

### 1. Twitter/X (PRIMARY — daily activity)
**Profile setup:**
- Bio: "Agency founder → Solo builder. I ship landing pages in 24h for $300-500. AI-powered. DM me. 🚀"
- Pinned tweet: Main offer thread
- Link: Landing page with UTM

**Daily cadence:**
- 1 original tweet/thread about the service or building process
- 5-10 replies to founders/makers (genuine, helpful — not spammy)
- 3-5 DMs to potential leads

**Content types:**
- Build logs ("Just shipped this LP in 3 hours")
- Before/after comparisons
- Tips on LP conversion
- Client testimonials
- "Taking 2 more clients this week" urgency posts

**Search queries to monitor:**
- "need a landing page"
- "looking for web developer"
- "launching soon"
- "building in public"
- "SaaS launch"
- "my landing page sucks"

### 2. LinkedIn (2-3x/week)
**Post types:**
- Personal story posts (MARKETING.md versions)
- Case study posts (with screenshots)
- "Building in public" journey updates

**Strategy:** LinkedIn favors long-form personal narratives. Use the copy from MARKETING.md, post in the morning (8-9 AM Jakarta time = good for US evening engagement).

### 3. IndieHackers (2-3 posts in Week 1)
- Launch post (MARKETING.md template)
- Engage in "Show IH" and "Ask IH" threads
- Comment on other builders' posts with genuine help
- Profile link → landing page

### 4. Reddit (2-3 posts, ongoing comments)
**Subreddits:**
- r/SideProject (launch post)
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong (journey post)
- r/smallbusiness (helpful advice + mention service)
- r/startups (same)
- r/webdev (share process, not sell)

**Rule:** Be helpful first, promote second. Reddit hates blatant ads.

### 5. ProductHunt (Week 2 or 3 — need social proof first)
- Wait until you have 2-3 client testimonials
- Launch on a Tuesday/Wednesday
- Prepare: tagline, description, images, maker comment
- Rally votes from existing network

## Outreach Templates

### Cold DM — Twitter (to founders who recently launched/are building)
```
Hey [Name]! Saw you're working on [product] — looks awesome.

Quick thought: I build landing pages in 24 hours for $250-400 (launch week pricing). I'm an agency founder using AI to ship 10x faster.

If you ever need a page or a redesign, happy to chat. No pressure either way!

Here's my site if curious: https://mpwh.github.io/lp-in-24h/
```

### Cold DM — to founders with BAD landing pages
```
Hey [Name]! Love the idea behind [product].

Honest take: your landing page might be underselling it. The product seems great but the page doesn't show it well.

I build conversion-optimized landing pages in 24 hours for $250-400. Would love to give yours a glow-up if you're interested.

No pressure — just thought it could help you convert more! 🚀
```

### Cold Email
```
Subject: Your landing page, rebuilt in 24 hours

Hey [Name],

Found [product] on [ProductHunt/Twitter/IH] — cool concept.

I'm Pandu, founder of Etalas (software agency). I just launched a service where I build landing pages in 24 hours for $300-500 using AI.

Same quality as a $3K agency job. Just faster.

You fill a 10-min brief → I build → You get a preview link tomorrow.

If I miss the 24h deadline, you don't pay.

Want me to send you a brief? Just reply "yes."

Cheers,
Pandu

```

### Warm DM — to personal network
```
Hey [Name]! Quick one — I just launched a new service: landing pages built in 24 hours for $250-400.

Using AI (Claude + Cursor) to ship 10x faster than the typical agency timeline.

Do you (or anyone you know) need a landing page right now? Would love your first clients to be people I actually know. 🙏

Here's the page: https://mpwh.github.io/lp-in-24h/
```

### Community Post (Slack/Discord groups)
```
👋 Hey everyone! I'm Pandu, I run a software agency called Etalas.

I just launched a productized service: Landing Pages in 24 Hours for $300-500.

How it works:
1. You fill a 10-min brief
2. I build with AI (Claude + Cursor)
3. You get a live preview in <24 hours

Built by me personally (not outsourced). Astro + Tailwind, deployed on Vercel.

If I miss the deadline, you don't pay.

Taking 3 clients this week at a launch discount ($250/$400).

DM me or check it out: https://mpwh.github.io/lp-in-24h/

## Quick Wins — First 3 Paying Clients

### Strategy 1: Warm Network (highest probability)
1. List every founder/business owner you know personally
2. Send the warm DM template to top 20
3. Offer launch pricing ($250 Standard)
4. Expected conversion: 2-3 out of 20

### Strategy 2: "Free Redesign" Bait
1. Find 3-5 indie products with terrible landing pages (ProductHunt, Twitter)
2. Build a quick redesign mockup (30 min each, just hero section)
3. DM the founder: "Hey, I redesigned your LP for fun. Want the full version for $250?"
4. Expected conversion: 1-2 out of 5

### Strategy 3: "Building in Public" Momentum
1. Tweet your build process daily
2. Someone will DM you — this happens reliably with consistent content
3. Expected conversion: 1 client from inbound by end of week

### Strategy 4: Community Hunting
1. Monitor these daily:
   - IndieHackers "I'm launching X" posts
   - r/startups "roast my landing page" threads
   - Twitter "just launched" tweets
   - ProductHunt upcoming products
2. Offer to help with genuine comment, then pitch
3. Expected conversion: 1 client from communities

### Strategy 5: Offer a "Pay What You Want" First Client
- If by Wednesday you have 0 clients, offer 1 free/PWYW build
- Use it for the case study and testimonial
- This unblocks everything else
